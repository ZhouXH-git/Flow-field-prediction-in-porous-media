# Flow-field-prediction-in-porous-media
Predicting the pore flow velocity directly from the sub-sampled pore structure is an ill-conditioned problem. Inspired by multi-grid methods for solving systems of linear equations, we use velocity fields simulated on coarse meshes to remedy such ill-conditioning. This leads to a super-resolution-assisted geometry-to-velocity mapping for porous media.
