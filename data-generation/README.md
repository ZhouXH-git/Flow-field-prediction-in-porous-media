# Data generation for porous media flows
The data generation for porous media flows has two steps: (1) generating binary images of porous media and (2) simulating the single-phase flows though the porous media. 
## Binary images
In this work, we generate two types of 3D porous media: (1) fully packed porous media and (2) porous media with interior large vuggy pore space (i.e., cavity). The latter is designed to mimic the carbonate rocks which are rich in large fractures and vuggy pores and are highly relevant to hydrocarbon energy recovery in carbonate reservoirs.

- The first type of porous media can be easily generated by using the [open-source SpherePackTools package](https://github.com/JamesEMcClure/SpherePackTools) developed by J. McClure;
- The second type of porous media is obtained based on the first type. Specifically, we assume a large spherical pore space at the center of the porous medium and remove all grains (i.e., spheres) within this pore space. The code for generating the second type of porous media is provided in
```create_cavity.ipynb```.
