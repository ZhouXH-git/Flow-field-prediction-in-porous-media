# Flow-field-prediction-in-porous-media
Predicting the pore flow velocity directly from the sub-sampled pore structure is an ill-conditioned problem. Inspired by multi-grid methods for solving systems of linear equations, we use velocity fields simulated on coarse meshes to remedy such ill-conditioning. This leads to a super-resolution-assisted geometry-to-velocity mapping for porous media.

The methodology was developed by Xu-Hui Zhou and Dr. Heng Xiao at Virginia Tech: [Data-Enabled Computational Mechanics Laboratory at Virgnia Tech](https://www.aoe.vt.edu/people/faculty/xiaoheng/personal-page.html).
